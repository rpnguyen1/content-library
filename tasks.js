✨ Experiment with text reveal animations (fade-in, typewriter, pop-up) or change text mid-clip for engagement
✨ Layer in filters, scroll effects, overlays to add depth & richness
✨ Keep it authentic & relatable with natural moments

✅ Why This Matters
POV vlogs with a local flavor are trending big in the US right now. Adding creative text animation helps your template stand out, go viral, and drive higher GMV 💸.

📅 Task Period: 9/19 – 9/26
📌 When you post, use hashtag: #ProViral67

🎯 Theme: The “6-7” Trend
Creators — this week we’re jumping on one of TikTok’s hottest memes right now: the “6-7” trend.

🧐 What’s the “6-7” Trend?
This meme blew up thanks to the viral lyric “six-seven” in Doot Doot (6 7) by Skrilla — originally paired with NBA player LaMelo Ball (he’s 6′7″).
Now, TikTok uses it for:
✨ Jokes about height (6′7″)
✨ 67% test scores or random “67” numbers
✨ Funny life moments or setups leading to a chaotic dump
✨ Comedy edits where “6-7” is the punchline
This is everywhere right now — your job is to turn it into scroll-stopping, high-quality templates that people want to pay to use.

🎯 Your Task
✔ 67 Soundtrack + Dump
Use the Doot Doot (6 7) soundtrack https://www.tiktok.com/music/son-original-7472085672402078486
Pair it with selfies, party dumps, sports highlights, travel clips — anything that delivers a funny punchline
Add text captions to set up the joke (“when I get 67% on my test” → celebration dump)
