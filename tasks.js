🔥 Theme: POV Vlog + Text Animation
This week, we want to see POV-style vlogs with a local twist — but elevated with text animation to make them go viral.

🎯 Your Task
✔ Create POV vlog-style templates using UGC-style, US-local footage (think: Target run, coffee shop visit, CAVA lunch, farmer’s market stroll)
✔ Add animated or changing text at the start to catch attention & set the vibe
✔ Make it complex & polished — multiple clips, smooth transitions, maybe sound cues — so it feels premium & worth using

💡 Editing Tips
✨ Use playful, conversational text (“POV: You’re coming with me to Target” / “Come with me to grab lunch”)
✨ Experiment with text reveal animations (fade-in, typewriter, pop-up) or change text mid-clip for engagement
✨ Layer in filters, scroll effects, overlays to add depth & richness
✨ Keep it authentic & relatable with natural moments

✅ Why This Matters
POV vlogs with a local flavor are trending big in the US right now. Adding creative text animation helps your template stand out, go viral, and drive higher GMV 💸.
