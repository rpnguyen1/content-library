    <p>This website is a static webpage that simply provides links to where to download footage.
        It does not store any videos. User accounts are probably never going to be implemented,
        mostly for security reasons and to keep it simple. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Since this library is for copyright free footage, I can't really add footage form
        other sites like pinterest or instagram since I can't verify the copyright status of those videos.
        I can‚Äôt officially encourage using copyrighted content‚Äîlike music from TikTok, or images from Instagram or Pinterest. 
        If you choose to use it, the responsibility is yours.

        That said, many creators do use popular clips and see strong engagement. 
        Just be aware: copyright owners can file takedowns or claims if they notice their content being 
        used without permission.
