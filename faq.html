    <p>This website is a static webpage that simply provides links to where to download footage.
        It does not store any videos. User accounts are probably never going to be implemented,
        mostly for security reasons and to keep it simple. 
        Since this library is for copyright free footage, I can't really add footage form
        other sites like pinterest or instagram since I can't verify the copyright status of those videos.
        However, if you want to use footage from those sites, you have to look for the copyright status yourself.
