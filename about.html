    <h2>About This Project</h2>
    <p>
        This is a demo content library for template creators. I know finding footage for templates is often very time consuming. 
        So I created this to help make it easier for template creators to find footage for their templates. 
        All footage is copyright free and can be used in commercial projects without attribution.
        It has a search function, type filter, and category filter to help you find footage quickly.
        If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know!

    <p> 
        Since this library is for copyright free footage, I can't really add footage form
        other sites like pinterest or instagram since I can't verify the copyright status of those videos.
        I can’t officially encourage using copyrighted content—like music from TikTok, or images from Instagram or Pinterest. 
        If you choose to use it, the responsibility is yours.

        That said, many creators do use popular clips and see strong engagement. 
        Just be aware: copyright owners can file takedowns or claims if they notice their content being 
        used without permission.
    </p>
        <p>This website is a static webpage that simply provides links to where to download footage.
        It does not store any videos. User accounts are probably never going to be implemented,
        mostly for security reasons and to keep it simple.
