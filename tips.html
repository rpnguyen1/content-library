      <h2>Weekly Updates & Rule Changes</h2>
Aug 21, 2025
📢 Important Update for Weekly Rewards
We’ve made a small adjustment to the 3+ task submission reward requirements:

👉 At least ONE of your 8+ submissions must be from our group’s exclusive task theme.
If none of your submissions follow the exclusive task, you won’t be eligible for the 3+ reward.

✅ Note: This doesn’t mean creating more templates. You just need to swap one of your 3+ submissions to match the exclusive task for the week.

Let’s keep the creativity flowing and make those exclusive tasks shine! 🔥

👉Key takeaway:
The main thing to draw from these examples is that having a clear purpose, with the footage, color grading, composition, effects, and typography all supporting that purpose makes a template look good. These three stand out the most, even though each has some room to improve. Also, when templates lack complex effects or strong visual design, there's less reason for someone to buy them.
