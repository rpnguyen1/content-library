üî•Here's what a GOOD template looks like (Check these out!) üî•

üëâKey takeaway:
The main thing to draw from these examples is that having a clear purpose, with the footage, color grading, composition, effects, and typography all supporting that purpose makes a template look good. These three stand out the most, even though each has some room to improve. Also, when templates lack complex effects or strong visual design, there's less reason for someone to buy them.
